🎬 Movie Genres Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a movie genres dataset. The goal is to explore trends, patterns, and insights related to various movie genres by performing a series of data preprocessing, visualization, and analytical tasks using Python and popular data science libraries.

📁 Project Overview
This analysis includes the following steps:

📥 Data Collection & Loading

Loaded the movie genres dataset into a Jupyter Notebook environment using pandas.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

Converted data types and formatted columns for analysis.

Filtered and normalized genre information where necessary.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored basic statistics of the dataset.

Analyzed the distribution of movies across genres.

Identified the most and least frequent genres.

Investigated average ratings, revenue, or popularity per genre (if available).

📊 Data Visualization

Used matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations:

Bar charts showing genre frequency

Pie charts of genre share

Line graphs or histograms for rating and revenue trends

Heatmaps for correlation between numerical features

📈 Genre-wise Analysis

Compared movie count, average rating, and other metrics across different genres.

Identified top-performing genres by popularity or box office metrics.

Detected genre trends over time (if temporal data was included).

🧠 Insights & Conclusion

Summarized key findings about genre popularity, performance, and diversity.

Shared recommendations or interesting observations drawn from the data.
